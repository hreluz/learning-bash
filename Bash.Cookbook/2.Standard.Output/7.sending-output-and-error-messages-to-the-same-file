    both > outfile 2>&1  same as both 1> outfile 2>&1

    So the standard output will be redirected to outfile, but also the standard
    error because 2>&1 says that the stderror should be redirected to the >&1

    the other way around will be:
  
    both 2> outfile 1>&2

    where the stderror goes to outfile and the  stdin will be redirected where stderror is bein saved
    

EOF
